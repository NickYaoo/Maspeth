For example, they have selections in Asian Cusine like Thai Mission and also sports bar style places like the O’Neill’s. However, it is important to note that there may not be as many restaurants and bars as this is a residential area with the majority of people needing to commute almost 40 minutes to get to work each day. With half the population being single, there is a chance that many will just eat in the surrounding neighborhoods or closer to their workplace rather than in Maspeth, thus the smaller selection of restaurants and bars. 

## Summary of Observations for HC3
In order to determine how each of our Queens neighborhoods ranked in terms of desirability for outdoor dining, we compared each one using the following desirable qualities: walk score, transit score, and income. Walk Score measures how readily the residents of a neighborhood can access the restaurants. People walking around the neighborhood could spot the restaurants and decide to stay and eat. Transit Score measures how readily consumers outside the neighborhood can access the restaurants. People need to be able to access the restaurants easily if they hear about them through advertisements. Income  is used to determine the cost of living. This then indicates more opportunities for restaurants to operate and be supported. We first ranked each neighborhood by a criteria and awarded 1 to 5 points (5 being the best and 1 being the worst). Then we totaled the points to determine a final ranking. For all metrics, walk score, transit score and median income, the higher the number is, the more points each neighborhood received. In terms of desirability of outdoor dining, our metrics indicate the following for our respective neighborhoods in Queens (from best to worst): Ridgewood, Jackson Heights, Astoria, Maspeth, Flushing. Ridgewood has the best balance of walkability, train access, and income to create an environment ideal for people to start restaurants that have outdoor dining while being easily accessible to people in and out of the area.

This bar graph compares each borough (Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx) and their percentages of sidewalks, roadways, both, and open streets. Based on the percentages, all four boroughs prefer sidewalks to roadways. Within the analyzed boroughs, the average sidewalk areas are greater than all their average roadway areas. Plot #2 further supports the idea synthesized from Plot #1 that Queens has a stronger preference for sidewalks when compared to the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan. However, when compared to the Bronx, Queens has a weaker preference than the Bronx.

This bar graph compares each of our neighborhoods in Queens. This is a comparative bar plot with sidewalk average area in the blue and roadway average area in the orange.

This difference may be indicative of the space available for outdoor dining. More average space on the sidewalks reflect the higher amounts of sidewalk outdoor dining in Queens compared to the roadway outdoor dining as seen on Plot #2.
